Hi, welcome to my page!

I am a <strong>fourth-year PhD student</strong> at <em>Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies</em>. 
During April-September 2024 I visited the School of Economics and Finance of <em>Queen Mary University of London</em>.

From June to September 2025, I will be in Frankfurt doing a <strong>PhD internship</strong> in the Fiscal Policies Division at the <em>European Central Bank (ECB)</em>.

My main research interests lie in the field of <strong>Applied Macroeconomics</strong>, primarily in three research areas:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
  <ul>
    <li>The macroeconomic effects of aggregate demand dynamics in the medium- and long-run (hysteresis effects), with particular attention on nonlinear transmission mechanisms.</li>
    <li>The macroeconomic impacts of climate change, particularly how climate-induced shocks affect tail risks in GDP growth.</li>
    <li>Evaluating the empirical performance of macroeconomic models using time series techniques, with a focus on both macro Agent-based and DSGE models.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
