Hi, welcome to my page!

I am a fourth-year PhD student at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies. During April-September 2024 I visited the School of Economics and Finance of Queen Mary University of London.

From June to September 2025, I will be in Frankfurt doing a PhD internship in the Fiscal Policies Division at the European Central Bank (ECB).

My main research interests lie in the field of Applied Macroeconomics, primarily in three research areas. First, I study the macroeconomic effects of aggregate demand dynamics in the medium- and long-run (hysteresis effects), placing particular attention on nonlinear transmission mechanisms. Second, I use empirical tools to examine the macroeconomic impacts of climate change, particularly how climate-induced shocks affect tail risks in GDP growth. Lastly, I am also interested in evaluating the empirical performance of macroeconomic models using time series techniques, with a focus on both macro Agent-based and DSGE models.
