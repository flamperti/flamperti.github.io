***Are Hysteresis Effects Nonlinear?*** (with O. Carnevale)  
(Draft available soon)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
This paper investigates the nonlinear effects of aggregate demand dynamics over medium and long-term horizons, focusing on whether contractionary aggregate demand shocks have distinct long-lasting impacts compared to expansionary shocks (sign dependence). We begin by identifying a long-term demand shock, termed the 'hysteresis' shock, within a structural vector autoregression framework. To assess sign dependence, we employ local projections with a nonlinear transformation of the shock. This methodology is applied to a quarterly U.S. macroeconomic dataset that includes variables related to the productivity and labor market channels of hysteresis.
Our findings indicate that contractionary shocks tend to have stronger and more persistent adverse effects, particularly on productivity-related outcomes, while expansionary shocks gain relevance over time for labor market variables. When disaggregating by demographic groups, we find more pronounced responses among disadvantaged workers, indicating greater sensitivity to both weak aggregate demand and high-pressure economic conditions.

***Climate Growth-at-Risk*** (with C. Brownlees, G. Fagiolo and F. Lamperti)  
(Draft available soon)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
We propose the Climate Growth-at-Risk framework, an empirical approach that quantifies the impacts of climate-related shocks on the entire forecast distribution of GDP growth. We consider two types of climate risks factors: country-specific temperature and precipitation shocks to capture gradual shifts in climate, and global temperature shocks as proxies for extreme events. We employ panel quantile local projections to examine dynamic tail risks to GDP growth. Using a global dataset covering 167 countries from 1960 to 2019, we find that local temperature and precipitation shocks have asymmetric effects along the growth distribution when conditioning on country characteristics. In rich countries, local temperature shocks increase downside risks whereas in poorer countries, they primarily reduce upside potential. Similarly, agricultural countries experience constraints in growth opportunities following precipitation shocks. Conversely, global temperature shocks not only exert larger and more persistent negative effects that than local ones but also suppress upside growth potential even in the full sample. Altogether, our findings identify climate change as an additional risk factor for macroeconomic vulnerability---one that stabilization policy must consider amid accelerating global warming.

***Estimation of DSGE models by Non-Gaussian Vector Autoregressions*** (with M. Martinoli, A.
Moneta, and R. Seri)  
(Draft available upon request)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
 We propose a new impulse response matching procedure for estimating the parameters of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model from observed macroeconomic time series. Our estimator hinges on an indirect inference approach in which the auxiliary model is a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model. The SVAR model is identified using independent component analysis. A specificity of our approach is that, by using a minimum distance index, we exploit the non-Gaussianity of the observed data, but we allow the model-simulated data to be Gaussian. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator and we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to  study the performance of the proposed procedure. Finally, we present an application to a simple New Keynesian DSGE model.
